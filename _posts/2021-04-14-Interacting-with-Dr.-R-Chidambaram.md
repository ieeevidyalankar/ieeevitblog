It’s not always you get to listen to someone who is of a similar stature and who has worked with Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam. And for me, it felt like one of my dreams had come true. I always wanted to meet Dr. Kalam from the time I started reading his books but unfortunately was never able to. But because of **IRIS**, I got to listen to someone who was as brilliant as Dr. Kalam. He was none other than Dr. Rajagopala Chidambaram Sir!! Our guest speaker for IRIS 2021!! We consider ourselves extremely lucky and fortunate to have him at IRIS and listen to him.

First thing I would like to say about Sir is that such a big personality but no hint of ego, no arrogance just an epitome of pure knowledge, experience, wisdom and a strong sense of nationalism.

What a session!! So inspiring and motivating. It made me realise the reason why I took science as my career. It made me realise the power and influence of scientists and engineers and what difference they can create in society. It made me realise that India needs our very own talent to create new technologies from scratch and be the first to create them. Such was the electrifying effect the session had on me! I remembered my childhood dream of wanting to work for the progress of the country especially in the field of science and technology. But busy schedules, assignments, exams and many other things make you forget your passion and dreams. It truly got reignited because of Sir.

The way he explained the concept of how the world needs more visionary leaders to take a leap in the field of technology was awe-inspiring. Especially the example of Dr. Homi Bhabha and Dr. Vikram Sarabhai who when the time our country was lagging in areas to provide basic facilities dreamt of a future in nuclear and space technology which was indeed remarkable.

Sir didn’t stop over there, he connected with us, youth, by talking about the recent trends and technologies like quantum computing, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and many more and how these are changing the world. Also, he talked about how India developed it’s own indigenous nuclear program when the other countries were not ready to transfer and share the technology. Truly got goosebumps at that point!!!

Well, one fact from my side, even the space technology that ISRO uses today especially the ASLV, GSLV, cryogenic engines, all were developed from scratch by the brilliant scientists and engineers of ISRO!! I read it in a book by R. Aravamudan(an Ex- ISRO Scientist) called 'ISRO- A personal History.’ Amazing book, I do recommend it to everyone!!

And last but not the least, the Q&A session with Sir. His anecdotes with Dr. Kalam, the way he explained his vision of India in term of the advancement of technology and his Pokhran experience, how and why today’s new generation, the youth of the country can contribute to the in R&D, it was an absolute treat to hear him. It never felt like we were talking to someone whose wisdom and the experience was so rich.

Oh, I forgot the main incident that happened before Sir’s talk began!! I was the only one contacting Sir on the e-mail since I was the IRIS Coordinator so he just knew my name from IEEE-VIT. And the first thing he said before starting his talk was my name, "Is Kinnari Bhalerao here?" I was so flustered. Like I had no words. It was a big moment for me.

Trust me it was the best day of my life. I literally had tears of joy and satisfaction after the talk. I started crying after the talk for a few minutes since I was so overwhelmed, happy and joyful and was experiencing a dozen other emotions at that time. I had no words to express my happiness of listening to Sir and hearing my name from his mouth unknowingly though was a cherry on the cake!!

Being an IRIS Coordinator gave me the opportunity to interact with such an inspiring and great personality like Dr. Chidambaram Sir. I will never forget this day and experience. When the chairperson of the committee was delivering the vote of thanks, I felt like saying on the microphone, _" Sir, please don’t stop. We want to hear from you. We want to hear those invaluable words of wisdom. Sir, please don’t stop. Keep talking, we will continue to listen. Our generation needs this kind of knowledge and wisdom."_

## "Always work on important problems, important to science or important to society."

## "Develop your interest, you will find a niche."

These two quotes from his talk are truly something that I gave a thought for some time and I will remember for a lifetime and try to inculcate it in my life.

I just had no words. Just sheer joy and satisfaction at the end of the day. **7th February 2021**, a day forever etched in my heart.
