    description: " 'Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known.' My favourite quote and I consider this is what keeps me going and that's one of the reasons why I love to write. I'm a huge physics and astronomy enthusiast with a curiosity to understand technology and someone who wants to know, 'How things work?'. Nevertheless, I find solace in art, writing and reading thrillers in my free time."
